# Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions about light-hooks? We've compiled the most common questions and their answers to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

### What is light-hooks?
light-hooks is a collection of lightweight, reusable React hooks designed to simplify common functionality in your applications. It includes hooks for countdowns, click detection, mobile detection, and network pinging.

### How do I install light-hooks?
```bash
npm install light-hooks
# or
yarn add light-hooks
# or
pnpm add light-hooks
```

### Is TypeScript supported?
Yes! light-hooks is built with TypeScript and includes full type definitions out of the box.

### What React versions are supported?
light-hooks supports React 16.8+ (any version with hooks support) and is fully compatible with React 18.

## Usage Questions

### How do I import hooks?
Use named imports for better tree-shaking:
```tsx
import { useCountdown, useClickOutside } from 'light-hooks';
```

### Can I use multiple instances of the same hook?
Absolutely! Each hook instance maintains its own independent state:
```tsx
const [timer1] = useCountdown(60);  // 1-minute timer
const [timer2] = useCountdown(30);  // 30-second timer
const [timer3] = useCountdown(10);  // 10-second timer
```

### Why isn't my useCountdown timer updating the UI?
Make sure you're using the returned state value in your component:
```tsx
// ✅ Correct - Component re-renders when timeLeft changes
const [timeLeft, { start }] = useCountdown(60);
return <div>Time: {timeLeft}s</div>;

// ❌ Wrong - timeLeft value not used in render
const [timeLeft, { start }] = useCountdown(60);
return <div>Timer is running...</div>;
```

### How do I properly use useClickOutside?
Always attach the ref to the element you want to monitor:
```tsx
const ref = useRef(null);
useClickOutside(ref, () => {
  console.log('Clicked outside!');
});

return <div ref={ref}>Click outside this div</div>;
```

### Why does isMobile return wrong values?
For SSR applications, check the value after component mount:
```tsx
const [isMobileDevice, setIsMobileDevice] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsMobileDevice(isMobile());
}, []);
```

### How do I handle CORS errors with usePing?
Use CORS-enabled endpoints or your own API:
```tsx
// ✅ Use CORS-enabled endpoint
const { ping, isOnline } = usePing('https://httpbin.org/ping');

// ✅ Or use default endpoint
const { ping, isOnline } = usePing();
```

## Framework Integration

### Can I use light-hooks with Next.js?
Yes! For client-only hooks, use dynamic imports to avoid SSR issues:
```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const ClientComponent = dynamic(() => import('./MyComponent'), {
  ssr: false
});
```

### Does it work with React Native?
Most hooks work with React Native, but browser-specific ones like `isMobile` may need adaptation for mobile environments.

### What about Gatsby or other SSR frameworks?
Similar to Next.js, use dynamic imports for client-only hooks or check for `typeof window !== 'undefined'` before using browser-specific features.

## Performance & Best Practices

### How do I prevent unnecessary re-renders?
Memoize callback functions passed to hooks:
```tsx
const handleComplete = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Timer completed!');
}, []);

const [timeLeft, controls] = useCountdown(60, {
  onComplete: handleComplete
});
```

### Do I need to clean up hooks manually?
No! All light-hooks handle cleanup automatically when components unmount. Timers, event listeners, and other resources are properly cleaned up.

### Can I customize hook behavior?
Yes, most hooks accept options objects:
```tsx
const [timeLeft, controls] = useCountdown(60, {
  autoStart: true,
  interval: 1000,
  onComplete: () => console.log('Done!'),
  onTick: (time) => console.log('Current:', time)
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package not found during installation
Ensure you're using the correct package name:
```bash
npm install light-hooks  # Correct
npm install react-light-hooks  # Wrong
```

### TypeScript errors after installation
1. Restart your TypeScript server: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
2. Update to latest version: `npm update light-hooks`
3. Check your `tsconfig.json` includes proper module resolution

### Hooks not working in production build
1. Ensure proper tree-shaking with named imports
2. Check for SSR/hydration mismatches
3. Verify browser compatibility

### Memory leaks or performance issues
1. Use `useCallback` for callback functions
2. Don't start timers inside `useEffect` without proper cleanup
3. Let hooks handle their own cleanup automatically

## Advanced Usage

### Can I extend or customize hooks?
Yes! You can create wrapper hooks:
```tsx
function useCustomCountdown(initialTime: number) {
  const [timeLeft, controls] = useCountdown(initialTime, {
    onComplete: () => {
      // Custom completion logic
      alert('Time\'s up!');
    }
  });
  
  return [timeLeft, controls];
}
```

### How do I contribute new hooks?

### Are there plans for more hooks?
Yes! Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Gourav2609/light-hooks/issues) for planned features and feel free to suggest new hooks.

## Common Patterns

### Loading states with multiple hooks
```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const { isOnline } = usePing();
  const [timeLeft, { start }] = useCountdown(30);
  const isMobileDevice = isMobile();
  
  if (!isOnline) return <div>Offline</div>;
  if (isMobileDevice) return <MobileView />;
  
  return <DesktopView timeLeft={timeLeft} onStart={start} />;
}
```

### Conditional hook usage
```tsx
function ConditionalTimer({ shouldUseTimer }: { shouldUseTimer: boolean }) {
  // ✅ Hooks must always be called
  const [timeLeft, controls] = useCountdown(60);
  
  // ✅ Control behavior with effects
  useEffect(() => {
    if (shouldUseTimer) {
      controls.start();
    } else {
      controls.pause();
    }
  }, [shouldUseTimer]);
  
  return shouldUseTimer ? <div>Time: {timeLeft}</div> : <div>Timer disabled</div>;
}
```
