# Light Hooks Documentation

This is the documentation site for [light-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/light-hooks), a collection of lightweight and efficient React hooks for modern applications.

This documentation site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the documentation by modifying files in the `contents/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.
